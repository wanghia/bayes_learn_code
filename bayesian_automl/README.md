==================================================================================

This directory contains a sample submission for the ChaLearn AutoML2 challenge
			November 2017, version 5
==================================================================================

Usage:
`python code_submission_dir/run.py input_data_dir result_submission_dir code_submission_dir`


Instructions for creating a code submission (to be submitted to Codalab):

- The metadata file must be included and remain unchanged. 

- The directory structure and naming should remain unchanged.

- To create a valid submission, zip all the file with:
		zip -r zipfilename *
starting from this directory, i.e. do not zip the directory itself, just its contents.

- For zipfilename use something explicit to remember the nature of its contents (algorithm name, code version, etc.)

==================================================================================

Instructions for creating a result submission:

- You may also generate prediction results on your own computer and submit them as a zip file. This will work to enter the Tweakathon. To participate to the AutoML phase, you must submit CODE.
